## üìì Documentation

@todo

## üè∑Ô∏è Versioning

[SemVer](http://semver.org/) is followed closely. Minor and patch releases should not introduce breaking changes to the codebase; however, they might change the resulting AST or HTML output of parsed Markdown (due to bug fixes, spec changes, etc.)  As a result, you might get slightly different HTML, but any custom code built onto this library should still function correctly.

Any classes or methods marked `@internal` are not intended for use outside of this library and are subject to breaking changes at any time, so please avoid using them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance & Support

When a new **minor** version (e.g. `1.4` -> `1.5`) is released, the previous one (`1.4`) will continue to receive security and critical bug fixes for *at least* 3 months.

When a new **major** version is released (e.g. `1.5` -> `2.0`), the previous one (`1.5`) will receive critical bug fixes for *at least* 3 months and security updates for 6 months after that new release comes out.

(This policy may change in the future and exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis.)

**Professional support, including notification of new releases and security updates, is available through a [Tidelift Subscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/packagist-league-configuration?utm_source=packagist-league-configuration&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).**
